## Moon Phase Calendar – Data Visualization View

Moon Phase Calendar (Data Visualization View) is a **Python-based project** that computes and organizes daily moon phase data and visualizes it as a continuous phase trend across a month. Key lunar phases are highlighted on a plotted timeline, providing a clear and analytical view of moon cycles using **Matplotlib**.

This project was submitted by **Anushka**, a Grade 10 student, for the **CODE IT 3.0** competition conducted by [**eduSeed**](https://eduseed.in/), where she secured **Second Place**. The project demonstrates her creative and innovative approach to data visualization using Python.
